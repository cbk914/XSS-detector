# XSS-detector

# Prerequisites

The script requires Python 3.x and the 'requests' module to be installed.

# Usage

Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Run the script using the following command:

    python xss_detection.py -t <target>
    
  Replace <target> with the file or directory you want to scan for XSS vulnerabilities.  

The script will search for potential XSS vulnerabilities in the target file or directory and output any vulnerabilities found. If no vulnerabilities are found, it will output a message stating that no vulnerabilities were found.

The script supports both file and URL targets. If a URL is provided as the target, the script will fetch the content from the URL and save it to a temporary file before scanning for vulnerabilities.

If the target URL does not start with 'http://' or 'https://', the script will add the 'http://' prefix by default.

If the script finds potential XSS vulnerabilities, it will output the type of vulnerability (Reflected XSS, Stored XSS, or DOM-based XSS) along with the vulnerable code snippet.

The script uses regular expressions to search for potential XSS vulnerabilities, so it may not catch all types of vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use this script as part of a comprehensive web application security testing program.

The script is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Do not use this script to scan websites or web applications without the explicit permission of the site owner.

# XSS vulnerabilities

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of web vulnerability that allows attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. The primary goal of an XSS attack is to steal sensitive information, such as user credentials or session cookies, from legitimate users of a web application. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application by exploiting input validation vulnerabilities or by manipulating client-side scripts executed by a victim's browser. XSS attacks can be broadly categorized into three types: Reflected XSS, Stored XSS, and DOM-based XSS.

Reflected XSS: Reflected XSS attacks involve injecting malicious script into a web application that is then reflected back to the user in the application's response. Reflected XSS attacks typically rely on the victim clicking a link or submitting a form that contains the malicious script.

Stored XSS: Stored XSS attacks involve injecting malicious script into a web application that is then stored in the application's database or on the server-side. The injected script is then served to users who access the affected pages or components of the application.

DOM-based XSS: DOM-based XSS attacks involve injecting malicious script into a web application that is then executed by a victim's browser as part of the application's Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation code.
